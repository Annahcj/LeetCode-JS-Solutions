// 2127. Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting
// A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of n employees, waiting to be invited. They have arranged for a large circular table, capable of seating any number of employees.
// The employees are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee has a favorite person and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is not themself.
// Given a 0-indexed integer array favorite, where favorite[i] denotes the favorite person of the ith employee, return the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting.


// Solution: DFS & Length of Longest Cycle

// First, create a reverse graph: because we need to find the longest chains backwards

// Return the max of two cases:
  // 1. Total sum of: Pairs of nodes who are each other's favorites + the longest chains connected to each node.
  // 2. The length of the longest cycle.

// Time Complexity: O(n) 635ms
// Space Complexity: O(n) 184.8MB
