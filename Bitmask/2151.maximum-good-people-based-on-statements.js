// 2151. Maximum Good People Based on Statements
// There are two types of persons:
  // The good person: The person who always tells the truth.
  // The bad person: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.
// You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array statements of size n x n that represents the statements made by n people about each other. More specifically, statements[i][j] could be one of the following:
  // 0 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a bad person.
  // 1 which represents a statement made by person i that person j is a good person.
  // 2 represents that no statement is made by person i about person j.
// Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that statements[i][i] = 2 for all 0 <= i < n.
// Return the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements made by the n people.


// Solution: Combinations of Bitmasks

// Get all combinations for n people. Each person can be good or bad (1 or 0).
// Since n <= 15 and we only need to mark 1 or 0, we can use bitmasks to represent these combinations.
// For each combination, check if the combination is valid:
  // All statements made by good people must be correct
  // Statements made by bad people are completely disregarded
// If the combination is valid, get the number of ones in the bitmask, keep track of the largest number of ones.

// Time Complexity: O(2^n * n^2) 184ms
// Space Complexity: O(1) 39.1MB
