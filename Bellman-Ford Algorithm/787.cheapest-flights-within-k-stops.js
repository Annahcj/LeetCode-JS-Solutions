// 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
// There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
// You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.


// Solution: Bellman-Ford Algorithm

// Dynamic Programming Approach
// Keep two arrays, prev and curr (Arrays with length of n)
// Fill up prev and curr with Infinity
// Set prev[src] to 0 (since we are already at the src)
// Note: K stops means a maximum of k + 1 edges, so we can loop k times (since we have already calculated 0 edges ^^).
// Loop from 1 to k + 1 *
    // set curr[src] to 0 (since that is the origin)
    // loop through each [source, dest, weight] in flights **
        // if prev[source] is smaller than Infinity (valid path before)
            // set curr[dest] to Math.min(curr[dest], prev[source] + weight)
    // **
    // set prev to deep copy of curr
// *
// If curr[dst] is Infinity (not found), return -1, otherwise return curr[dst]

// e = edges, n = number of nodes
// Time Complexity: O(k * e) 158ms
// Space Complexity: O(n) 44.7MB
