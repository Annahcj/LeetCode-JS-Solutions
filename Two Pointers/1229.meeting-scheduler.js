// 1229. Meeting Scheduler
// Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.
// If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.
// The format of a time slot is an array of two elements [start, end] representing an inclusive time range from start to end.
// It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots [start1, end1] and [start2, end2] of the same person, either start1 > end2 or start2 > end1.


// Solution: Two Pointers w/ Sort

// 1. Sort slots1 and slots2 in asc order by their start times
// 2. Two pointers: i, j
  // get largest possible interval in slots1[i] and slots2[j]
  // if that interval is long enough (>= duration), return [start, start + duration]
  // otherwise, if slots[i]'s end is smaller than slots[j]'s end, increment i
  // otherwise increment j


// Proof of 'slots1[i][1] < slots2[j][1]':
// If slots1[i][1] < slots2[j][1], that means slots1[i] will not intersect with slots2[j + 1] at all since no two intervals overlap AND they are sorted by their start times.

// For e.g: 
// slots1: [[10,15], [16,30]]
// slots2: [[0,30], [40,50]]
// if i = 0 and j = 0, since slots1[0][1] < slots2[0][1], we increment i.
// slots1[0][1] (15) is smaller than slots2[1][0], which means they don't intersect at all.

// Time Complexity: O(n log(n) + m log(m)) 204ms
// Space Complexity: O(log(n)) (sorting) 49MB
