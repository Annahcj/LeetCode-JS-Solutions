// 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph
// You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer n which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi.
// A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.
// The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.
// Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trios.


// Solution: Adjacency List

// Keep edges in a hashmap for each vertex 
// edges: [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]
// graph = {
//   1: {2: true, 3: true, 4: true, degrees: 3},
//   2: {1: true, 3: true, 5: true, degrees: 3},
//   3: {1: true, 3: true, 5: true, degrees: 3},
//   4: {1: true, degrees: 1},
//   5: {2: true, degrees: 1},
//   6: {3: true, degrees: 1}
// }

// 1. Create adjacency list
// 2. Loop through all combinations of trios where i < j < k (to optimize time)

// Time Complexity: O(n^3) 192ms
// Space Complexity: O(V + E) 53.6MB
