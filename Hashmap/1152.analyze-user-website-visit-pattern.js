// 1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern
// You are given two string arrays username and website and an integer array timestamp. All the given arrays are of the same length and the tuple [username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]] indicates that the user username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
// A pattern is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).
// For example, ["home", "away", "love"], ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], and ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"] are all patterns.
// The score of a pattern is the number of users that visited all the websites in the pattern in the same order they appeared in the pattern.
// For example, if the pattern is ["home", "away", "love"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited "home" then visited "away" and visited "love" after that.
// Similarly, if the pattern is ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited "leetcode" then visited "love" and visited "leetcode" one more time after that.
// Also, if the pattern is ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited "luffy" three different times at different timestamps.
// Return the pattern with the largest score. If there is more than one pattern with the same largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern.


// Solution: Hashmap w/ Set & Sorting

// 1. Group by users -> user: [[timestamp, website]]
// 2. Sort groups by timestamp 
// 3. Generate triplets & count frequencies of triplets -> use hashset to make sure we are only adding unique triplets for each user
// 4. Return lexographically smallest triplet with highest user visit count.

// Time Complexity: O(n^3 * log(n)) 104ms
// Space Complexity: O(n^3) 46MB
