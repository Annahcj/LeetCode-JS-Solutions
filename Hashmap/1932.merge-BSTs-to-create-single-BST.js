// 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST
// You are given n BST (binary search tree) root nodes for n separate BSTs stored in an array trees (0-indexed). Each BST in trees has at most 3 nodes, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:
  // Select two distinct indices i and j such that the value stored at one of the leaves of trees[i] is equal to the root value of trees[j].
  // Replace the leaf node in trees[i] with trees[j].
  // Remove trees[j] from trees.
// Return the root of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing n - 1 operations, or null if it is impossible to create a valid BST.


// Solution: Hashmaps & Root-to-Value Mapping 

// A few things to keep in mind:
  // All root values are unique.
  // To create a valid BST, all root values (except the final root) must map to exactly one leaf value (there cannot be multiple leaf values which are the same)

// 1. Map roots to their matching leaves. Also keep track of the total count of nodes.
  // This total count would have counted every single node once, so after joining into a valid BST, exactly n - 1 nodes would have been counted twice. 
  // So, we subtract n - 1 from our nodes count.
// 2. Get the root which doesn't map to any leaf node, this is the final root.
// 3. Merge all the leaves -> roots together.
// 4. Validate the final tree. 

// Time Complexity: O(n) 516ms
// Space Complexity: O(n) 79.1MB
