// 1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations
// ou are given two arrays of integers nums1 and nums2, possibly of different lengths. The values in the arrays are between 1 and 6, inclusive.
// In one operation, you can change any integer's value in any of the arrays to any value between 1 and 6, inclusive.
// Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in nums1 equal to the sum of values in nums2. Return -1​​​​​ if it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.


// Solution: Greedy w/ Sorting

// 1. Get the sum of nums1 and nums2.
// 2. Collect all the 'changes' (the difference it would make towards the overall difference) from nums1 and nums2.
  // If sum1 > sum2: 
    // diff for num in nums1 = num - 1 
    // diff for num in nums2 = 6 - num
  // If sum1 < sum2:
    // diff for num in nums1 = 6 - num
    // diff for num in nums2 = num - 1
// 3. Sort the changes in descending order.
// 4. Reduce the overall diff by closing the gap with the changes. Stop when the overall diff is 0 or under.
// If the diff is still above 0 after the iteration is finished, return -1, otherwise return the number of iterations of the loop.

// Time Complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)) 279ms
// Space Complexity: O(n + m) 70.7MB
