// 1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters
// Given a string s, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s that contains all the distinct characters of s exactly once.


// Solution: Stack

// Time Complexity: O(n) 92ms
// Space Complexity: O(1) 39.3MB

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) lastIndex.set(s[i], i);
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let char = s[i];
    // if char isn't already in our stack
    if (!seen.has(char)) {
      // pop from stack and remove from seen while 
        // 1. last char of stack is smaller than current char
        // 2. AND last char of stack still has later occurances in s
