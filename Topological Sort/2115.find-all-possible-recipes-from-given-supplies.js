// 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies
// You have information about n different recipes. You are given a string array recipes and a 2D string array ingredients. The ith recipe has the name recipes[i], and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from ingredients[i]. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from other recipes, i.e., ingredients[i] may contain a string that is in recipes.
// You are also given a string array supplies containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.
// Return a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in any order.
// Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.


// Solution: Topological Sort

// 1. Map recipes to their indices.
// 2. Process the ingredients of each recipe,
  // Count the indegrees for each recipe
  // Add connected recipes to the graph
  // Skip over invalid recipes
// 3. Get recipes with indegree of 0
// 4. Process recipes based on topological order

// n = length of recipes, m = length of indegredients[i][j], k = length of supplies
// Time Complexity: O(nm + k) 132ms
// Space Complexity: O(nm + k) 56.4MB
