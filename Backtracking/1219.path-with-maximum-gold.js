// 1219. Path with Maximum Gold
// In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
// Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
  // Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
  // From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
  // You can't visit the same cell more than once.
  // Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
  // You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.


// Solution: Backtracking

// k <= 25 = number of cells which contain gold
// Time Complexity: O(3^k) 194ms
// Space Complexity: O(k) (call stack) 40.7MB
