// 1231. Divide Chocolate
// You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array sweetness.
// You want to share the chocolate with your k friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into k + 1 pieces using k cuts, each piece consists of some consecutive chunks.
// Being generous, you will eat the piece with the minimum total sweetness and give the other pieces to your friends.
// Find the maximum total sweetness of the piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.


// Solution: Binary Search

// n = length of sweetness, s = sum of sweetness, m = min of sweetness
// Time Complexity: O(n * log(s - m)) 84ms
// Space Complexity: O(1) 42MB
