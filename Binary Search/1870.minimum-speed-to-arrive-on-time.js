// 1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time
// You are given a floating-point number hour, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.
// Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.
  // For example, if the 1st train ride takes 1.5 hours, you must wait for an additional 0.5 hours before you can depart on the 2nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.
// Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.
// Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 10^7 and hour will have at most two digits after the decimal point.


// Solution: Binary Search

// Binary search for the minimum time.
// To calculate the total hours for a certain speed, use Math.ceil(hours) + (dist[i] / speed) for each distance to round up to the next integer each time.

// Time Complexity: O(n log(10^7)) 213ms
// Space Complexity: O(1) 53.9MB
